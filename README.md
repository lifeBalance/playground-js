# PlaygroundJS
Sometimes I just want to try out JavaScript stuff such as algorithms or the new cool features included in the new versions (ES6 and ES7). This is just a small project to make the process as fun and comfortable as possible, a playground for having fun with JavaScript.

Tools used in the project:

* [Gulp][], to automatize everything.
* [Browsersync][], for livereloading.
* [Browserify][], for using modules.
* [Babel][], so I can try out the last JavaScript features.

Also I like to take notes, so I'll be documenting the process of building this thing.
