# PlaygroundJS
Sometimes I just want to try out JavaScript stuff such as algorithms or the new cool features included in the new versions (ES6 and ES7). This is just a small project to make the process as fun and comfortable as possible, a playground for having fun with JavaScript.

Tools used in the project:

* [Gulp][1], to automatize everything.
* [Browsersync][2], as a development server.
* [Browserify][3], for using modules.

Also I like to take notes, so I'll be documenting the process of building this thing.

## Contents

* [Installing Gulp and Browsersync][c1]
* [Browserify][c2]
